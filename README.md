The task consists of estimating the hilariousness of

news headlines that have been modified manually by humans using micro-edit changes to make
them funny. Our approach is constructed to improve on a couple of aspects; preprocessing with
an emphasis on humor sense detection, using embeddings from state-of-the-art language model
(ELMo), and ensembling the results came up with using machine learning model Na ̈ıve Bayes
(NB) with a deep learning pretrained models. ELMo-NB participation has scored (0.5642) on the
competition leader board, where results were measured by Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
